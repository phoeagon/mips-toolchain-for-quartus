MIPS Toolchain for Quartus
===============================
phoeagon

This tool uses GCC cross compiling toolchain to generate memory
initialization files to be used Quartus, which can be flashed onto
dev. boards.

Instructions:
1. Install GCC mips toolchain on your system.
Install corresponding cross compiling version. If you are on x86,
try this prebuilt binary:

2. Edit the ".c" file in progs to what you want to execute on your CPU.
The toolchain does not recognize "main()", instead, execution starts at
your first function.

3. To build a bootloader-enabled version, with larger memory support,
use:
make bootloader

Alternatively, use make to get a "raw" version.

4. Flash the generated MIF file using Quartus.
